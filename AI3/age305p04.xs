   This inactive AI controls the Aztecs.  The Aztec city has no economy, but starts with some Aztec warriors and periodically gets 
   more through triggers which spawn them.  
   This AI uses these warriors to scout and defend it's city.  
   I don't really want them to attack the enemy AI city because it is really well fortified and they'll all just die and that will 
   be boring for the player.
