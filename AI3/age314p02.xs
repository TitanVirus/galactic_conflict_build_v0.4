   Summary:
   This is main AI for Scenario 14.  Warwick has a pre-built town (to which he can add buidings).  
   This AI is supposed to build up, build some army, perhaps several groups, and go out and attack Native Villages, 
   with the aim of killing the chief in each village.  There are 5 Villages, and when all the chiefs are dead, the player loses.  
   This AI should also launch some attacks against the player's town itself, and of course defend it's own resource-gathering efforts
   and town.
