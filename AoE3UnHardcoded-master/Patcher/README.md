# AoE3UnHardcode Patcher

This is a tool that has been developed with the purpose of making it easier for modders to use the features provided by this project.

How to use
----------

In order to use it, and thus apply the patches provided by this project in your mod's .exe, just download the main executable, and place it in any folder. We recommend placing it in your AoE3 Folder (usually C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires III for CD installations and C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\Age of Empires III\bin for Steam-based installations).

After that, just drag and drop your Age of Empires III TAD executable over the UHCPatcher application, or, if you placed it in your AoE3 folder, just open it and the executable will be detected automatically. After that, just select the patches you want to apply and click in "Apply".

Additionally, you can also compile the Patcher manually, using Visual Studio 2015, by using the source code provided in this repository.

To Do
-----
* Allow the Patcher to change the hardcoded filenames of some of the files that are loaded by the executable
* Add commandline options
